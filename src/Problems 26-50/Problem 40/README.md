# Problem 40
### Problem Analysis
- AN irrational number is generated by concatenating the positive integers: 0.123456789101112131415161718192021...
- 1,2,3,...,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,...
- The twelfth digit of the number is 1, the 15th digit is 2, the 20th digit is 4, and so on.
- The nth digit of the irrational number is the product of the digits at positions 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and so on.
- We need to find the product of the digits at these positions.

### Plan
- Have a loop to concatenate the positive integers until the length of the concatenated string is greater than 1000000.
- I will start with the max size of 1 million and then increase it if needed.
- For each number in the loop, I will convert it to a string then covert it to a list of characters.
- I will push those characters to a vector.
- Then after the loop is done, I will have a vector of characters.
- I will get the digits at positions 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000.
- Only problem is generating the positions. Which might take a while.

### Conclusion
- I overestimated the difficulty of the problem.
- I only needed to go up to 1 million digits.
- Easy to implement.
