# Problem 49
### Problem Analysis
- I am supposed to find the prime, under one million, that can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes.

### Plan
- I will check if a number is prime from numbers under one million.
- Then with each of those primes in a vector, I will iterate through the vector and try to find the sum of consecutive primes.
- If the sum of those primes equals a prime, I will check if it is the largest prime found so far.
- If it is, I will store it in a variable and return it at the end.
- Seems easy enough. Time to code!

### Conclusion
- I coded this pretty well, had some errors but fixed them.
- I coded a brute-force which took some time. I ran it in my Codespace to offload resources and energy.
- Also wrote output to a file just in case I don't see the printed output.
- EDIT: My brute force was wrong thanks to Copilot who helped a little too much, the new solution is much better and faster.
- Likely my last write-up for a while, I am going to focus on just coding and not writing about it.
- Thanks!
